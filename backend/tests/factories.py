"""Object factories for tests.

Two flavors:

- **Pure** (`make_*`) — construct ORM objects without touching the DB.
  Useful in unit tests that mock repositories.

- **Persisted** (`create_*_in_db`) — flush the object into the test
  session so subsequent SELECTs see it. Used by integration tests that
  want a pre-existing user before exercising an endpoint.

Defaults are deliberately permissive: random unique emails, a
strong-enough canned password, plausible names. Override any field
that the test cares about.
