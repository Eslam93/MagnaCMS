"""Pin the projection rule: image URL is computed fresh from
`s3_key` + storage config, NEVER read from the persisted `cdn_url`.

Round 1 refactored the storage layer so `cdn_url` is no longer the
source of truth — it's persisted on insert as a redundant cache for
backwards compatibility. The router projection at
`routers/content.py` reads `image.s3_key` and calls
`storage.public_url_for(...)`, which means a future change to
`IMAGES_CDN_BASE_URL` rewrites every row's wire URL with no DB
migration. This test asserts that contract by feeding the projector
a row whose `cdn_url` would be wrong if anyone ever re-read it.
