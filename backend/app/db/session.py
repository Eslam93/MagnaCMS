    config in `infra/lib/compute-stack.ts`, `pool_size=10,
    max_overflow=10` → 20 max concurrent connections per instance, so
    a fully-scaled fleet uses up to 60. That leaves ~25 headroom for

    Performance Insights collector.

    The image-regen NOWAIT lock (see `image_service` +
    `ContentRepository.get_for_user`) makes the LOSING request release
    its connection immediately, but the WINNER still holds the row
    lock — and therefore the DB connection — across the LLM-prompt
    call, image-provider call, and storage upload. Sizing assumes a
    handful of concurrent image generations per instance, not dozens.
