"""Improver prompt module — analyze + rewrite, two distinct calls.

Mirrors §7.6 of PROJECT_BRIEF.md. The brief asks for a two-pass chain:

  1. ANALYZE — given the original text plus a goal, return the issues
     the rewriter should fix and the planned changes that will fix
     them. Output: `{ issues, planned_changes }` (both string lists).
  2. REWRITE — given the original text, the goal, AND the planned
     changes from step 1, return the final improved text plus
     explanation bullets and a changes-summary block.

The two-step structure forces the model to *commit* to a plan before
writing, which empirically produces cleaner rewrites than a single
"please improve this" pass. The downside is two paid LLM calls per
invocation; the cost is summed onto the persisted `improvements` row.

Goal-specific guidance lives in `_goal_hint` so `build_analyze` and
`build_rewrite` stay close to the brief shape.
