"""Image-prompt builder.

Mirrors §7.5 of PROJECT_BRIEF.md. Runs as a separate LLM call AFTER
content generation: the model reads the rendered content plus a chosen
style and returns a structured `{ prompt, negative_prompt, style_summary }`
payload. The image provider then consumes that prompt.

Two providers; one schema:

- `gpt-image-1` (OpenAI) takes the positive `prompt` only and folds the
  `negative_prompt` text into it (see service-layer folding).
- Bedrock Nova Canvas takes a real negative prompt. Either way the
  payload shape stays the same — the builder is provider-agnostic.

`PROMPT_VERSION` is persisted on `generated_images.image_prompt` so we
can map a stored image back to the exact builder revision.

v2 revision (this file) addresses the "every image looks the same"
failure mode of v1:

  1. Style is no longer a single word — each style maps to concrete
     visual cues (lighting, palette, composition, materials) the model
     can act on. v1's "cinematic" and "photorealistic" produced nearly
     identical outputs because gpt-5.4-mini fell back to the same safe
     defaults when given a one-word direction.

  2. The user prompt now forces a brainstorm-then-pick step. v1 went
     straight to "produce an image prompt" and the model latched onto
     the most obvious visual metaphor for the topic — for any software
     content, that meant "developer at a desk." v2 explicitly tells the
     model to consider three metaphors and reject the cliché one.

  3. Specificity checklist on the output. Subject, environment,
     composition, lighting, palette must all be NAMED. v1's example
     "isometric three-quarter view" was the ONLY composition cue and
     biased every output toward that vantage.

  4. Negative prompt is now half-universal, half-topic-specific. v1's
     boilerplate "text, watermark, logos, faces" was useful but
     identical every time; v2 asks the model to add 2-3 content-aware
     cliché exclusions (e.g. "stock-photo handshake" for hiring posts,
     "anthropomorphic robot" for AI posts) — these matter on
     `gpt-image-1` because the negative folds into the positive as an
     "Avoid:" clause at generation time.
