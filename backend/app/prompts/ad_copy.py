"""Ad-copy prompt module.

Mirrors §7.3 of PROJECT_BRIEF.md. The prompt asks for three variants
labelled `short`, `medium`, `long` — the mock provider's canned response
locks the same three formats so downstream rendering doesn't have to
special-case the mock path. See `tests/providers/test_mock_providers.py`.

Bump `PROMPT_VERSION` whenever a string change here would alter
generation behavior in a way users could notice.
