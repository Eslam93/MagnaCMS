"""Health endpoint. Reports service version and downstream-dep status.

Probes attach as the components they depend on land:
  - ``db``     — real ``SELECT 1`` probe (wired in P1.2)
  - ``openai`` — real probe (wired in P1.7)
  - ``redis``  — real probe (wired in P11.x)
Unwired probes report ``unknown``.
