"""Per-path, per-IP in-memory rate limit middleware.

MVP-grade: a fixed-window counter keyed on `(rule_key, ip)` where
`rule_key` is either an exact-match path (`/api/v1/auth/login`) or the
pattern label of a regex-matched rule (`pattern:image_generate`).
Survives until P11.3 swaps in a Redis-backed sliding window that works
across processes and outlives restarts.

Scope:
  - Only the configured rules trigger limiting; everything else is a
    pass-through.
  - The "ip" identity is the real TCP peer (`scope["client"]`), NOT a
    forwarded-for header. Until we sit behind a proxy with a trusted
    XFF allowlist (P11.x), trusting client-supplied headers as security
    identity is a free DoS / impersonation vector. The audit-only XFF
    helper in `app/api/v1/routers/auth.py` is correctly NOT used here.

429 responses carry `Retry-After` (seconds) plus the project's standard
{error, meta} envelope.
