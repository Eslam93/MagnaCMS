"""Origin-based CSRF guard for cookie-authenticated state-changing requests.

The refresh cookie is `SameSite=none` in the deployed cross-site posture
(Amplify ↔ App Runner) so the browser sends it on any cross-origin POST
that opts in via `credentials: "include"`. Without this middleware, an
attacker page can fire `fetch("/api/v1/auth/refresh", { credentials:
"include" })` and force a token rotation (DoS-shaped) or, depending on
endpoint, a state change with the victim's identity.

This middleware enforces an Origin / Sec-Fetch-Site allowlist on the
small set of state-changing routes that authenticate purely via the
refresh cookie (`/auth/refresh`, `/auth/logout`). Bearer-authenticated
routes are not protected here because the access token isn't cookie-
borne — browsers won't auto-attach it from an attacker origin.

Allowed shapes for a request to pass:
  - No `Origin` header at all (curl, server-to-server) — accepted.
  - `Sec-Fetch-Site: same-origin` — browser confirmed same-origin.
  - `Origin` in the configured allowlist (`settings.cors_origins`).

Anything else returns 403 with the standard envelope. Returns 403 not
401 so the client doesn't trigger refresh-and-retry loops.
