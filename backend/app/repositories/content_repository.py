"""Data access for `content_pieces`.

Thin async repository — no business logic, no validation. The service
layer owns parse-fallback orchestration and the user-scoping rules; this
file just shuttles rows between the ORM and the caller.

Slice 4 adds the dashboard queries: paginated list with optional
content-type filter and full-text search, plus soft-delete and restore
(24-hour window). Active rows are the default — `get_for_user`
intentionally excludes soft-deleted records.
