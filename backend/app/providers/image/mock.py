"""MockImageProvider — returns a deterministic placeholder PNG.

Real-world image generation is slow (8–15s) and paid. The mock returns
the same shape (`ImageResult`) so the downstream S3-upload + URL-signing
code paths run unchanged. The PNG itself is a hardcoded 1×1 transparent
pixel — small, valid, and trivially identifiable in storage as
"not a real generated image."
