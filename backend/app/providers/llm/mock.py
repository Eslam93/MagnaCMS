"""MockLLMProvider — zero-cost, zero-key, fully working LLM stand-in.

Used by:
  - the test suite when no real provider is wanted
  - `AI_PROVIDER_MODE=mock` for demos and offline development

Returns canned JSON keyed by `content_type`. The shapes match the
schemas the brief defines for each prompt module (see §7 of
PROJECT_BRIEF.md). When real schemas land in Phase 3, these cannds
must keep matching — there is a test in `tests/providers/` that
parses each canned blob as JSON to catch drift early.
