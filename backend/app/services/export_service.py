"""Content export — Markdown only for now.

The brief's feature #3 lists "view, copy, download, delete" for the
dashboard; this is the download path. `rendered_text` on every
`ContentPiece` is already the canonical Markdown the renderer produced
at write time (Slice 2), so the export is mostly framing: a small
front-matter-style header + the body + a footer with the current
image URL (if any).

DOCX and PDF exports are tracked on the issue board ([#73], [#74]) —
both add a dependency (python-docx / reportlab) and warrant their own
slice. Markdown ships now because the lift is ~30 lines and closes the
dashboard "download" gap from the brief.
