"""Image storage abstraction.

Two implementations live behind one Protocol:

  - `LocalImageStorage` (default in dev) writes bytes to a local
    directory and returns a storage key. The mounted `/local-images/*`
    static path serves them; the public URL is derived at read time
    from `settings.images_cdn_base_url` + the key, NOT persisted on
    the row. That decouples the URL from the row, so a future S3
    cutover that only changes `IMAGES_CDN_BASE_URL` requires no row
    backfill.
  - `S3ImageStorage` (placeholder) — wires through to boto3 and a
    presigned URL once the deploy story is ready. Not part of this
    slice's local-first contract.

`build_image_storage()` picks the right one based on
`IMAGES_CDN_BASE_URL`. The image service consumes only the Protocol
so swapping is a config change.
