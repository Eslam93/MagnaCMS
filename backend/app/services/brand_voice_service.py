"""Brand-voice services.

Two unrelated responsibilities live here for now:

  1. Convert a `BrandVoice` row into the text block that prompt
     modules splice into the user prompt (`render_brand_voice_block`).
     Pure function; no I/O.
  2. CRUD helpers around the repository — thin wrappers that don't add
     orchestration today but give the router one place to import from.

If Slice 7+ adds business logic (e.g., enforcing one default voice per
user, or denying delete when in use), it lands here rather than in the
router.
