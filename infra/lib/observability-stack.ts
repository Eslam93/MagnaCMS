/**
 * ObservabilityStack — placeholder for CloudWatch alarms (P11.6) and
 * any other observability resources that DON'T have an App-Runner-
 * generated identifier baked into their name.
 *
 * Original P2.6 design: pre-create App Runner log groups with
 * explicit retention. That doesn't work — App Runner emits to
 * `/aws/apprunner/<service-name>/<service-id>/{service,application}`
 * where `service-id` is randomly assigned at create time. Pre-created
 * groups under `/aws/apprunner/<service-name>/{service,application}`
 * never receive traffic; App Runner creates its own groups with no
 * retention configured.
 *
 * The honest fix is to set retention post-deploy via a one-liner
 * `aws logs put-retention-policy` call. `DEPLOY.md` step 7a covers it.
 * The CloudWatch alarm sketch (P11.6) and any future SNS topics live
 * here when they land.
