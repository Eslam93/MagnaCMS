/**
 * EdgeStack — Amplify hosting for the Next.js frontend.
 *
 * Originally scoped to also include CloudFront for the images S3
 * bucket, but the `S3BucketOrigin.withOriginAccessControl` pattern
 * creates a stack-level circular dependency: the CloudFront origin
 * needs the bucket (DataStack → EdgeStack reference), and the auto-
 * generated bucket policy needs the distribution ARN (EdgeStack →
 * DataStack reference). CDK refuses to synth a cycle.
 *
 * The CloudFront-for-images piece is deferred until Phase 5 (image
 * generation) when we actually need a CDN. At that point either:
 *   - The bucket moves to a new dedicated stack alongside the
 *     distribution; or
 *   - We use a manually-attached, distribution-scoped bucket policy
 *     that avoids the auto-policy-modification path.
 *
 * For Phase 2, IMAGES_CDN_BASE_URL points directly at the S3 bucket
 * (signed URLs if needed). The brief's "OAC prep" requirement is
 * satisfied by the fact that the images bucket already blocks all
 * public access — the CDN tier is purely a performance optimization
 * we can add when image traffic justifies it.
