/**
 * NetworkStack — VPC, subnets, security groups.
 *
 * Design choices (per brief §11 — revised after P2.11 review):
 *
 *   - 2 AZs, PUBLIC subnets only. No private subnets, no NAT gateways.
 *     App Runner sits outside the VPC entirely (no VPC connector) so
 *     it can reach OpenAI/S3/Secrets Manager over public egress
 *     without VPC endpoint sprawl.
 *
 *   - RDS SG: inbound 5432 from 0.0.0.0/0. The original plan was to
 *     allowlist App Runner's egress prefix list, but AWS doesn't
 *     publish a stable per-service egress prefix list for the
 *     no-VPC-connector mode — the IDs I hardcoded were unverified.
 *     With no SG-level restriction available, security falls on:
 *       1. Auto-generated strong RDS password (in Secrets Manager,
 *          rotated by RDS not by us).
 *       2. SSL forced server-side via the Postgres parameter group
 *          (`rds.force_ssl=1`, attached in DataStack), and the
 *          backend also passes `?ssl=require` in the assembled DSN
 *          (`backend/app/core/aws_secrets.py`) so the client refuses
 *          plaintext fallback.
 *       3. Custom JWT auth at the app layer.
 *     For dev this is acceptable; prod will narrow when we adopt a
 *     VPC connector (P11.x) or move to RDS Proxy / Aurora Data API.
 *
 *   - Redis SG: unchanged surface (no public ingress). ElastiCache is
 *     reachable only from within the VPC, and App Runner without a
 *     VPC connector can't reach it. The backend runs with USE_REDIS=false
 *     in this phase; Redis lights up alongside the VPC-connector work.
