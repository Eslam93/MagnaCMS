# Deploying MagnaCMS to AWS — manual runbook

This document walks through the first `cdk deploy` and the post-deploy bootstrap steps. After that's done once, `deploy.yml` handles every subsequent push to `main`.

## Prerequisites

- AWS account with admin credentials (`aws configure` against the target account)
- Node 20+, Docker, AWS CDK CLI (`npm i -g aws-cdk@^2.180`)
- A funded OpenAI API key (sk-proj-…)
- Optional: a registered domain if you want `app.<your-domain>` / `api.<your-domain>` URLs instead of the AWS default `*.amplifyapp.com` / `*.awsapprunner.com`

## One-time setup

### 1. CDK bootstrap

```bash
cd infra
npm ci
aws configure  # if not already
npx cdk bootstrap aws://<ACCOUNT_ID>/us-east-1
```

This provisions the CDK toolkit stack (S3 bucket for assets, IAM roles) — required once per AWS account + region combination.

### 2. Deploy Network + Data stacks

Data must exist before the OpenAI secret can be populated, and the OpenAI secret must hold a real key before App Runner boots — the backend's config validator rejects the placeholder value in non-`local` environments. So Compute is split out into step 4.

```bash
npx cdk deploy magnacms-dev-network magnacms-dev-data -c env=dev
```

### 3. Populate the OpenAI API key

DataStack creates `magnacms-dev-openai-api-key` with an explicit placeholder string (`sk-proj-REPLACE_ME-...`). Populate it before Compute deploys so App Runner can pass the secret-strength validator on first boot:

```bash
aws secretsmanager put-secret-value \
  --secret-id magnacms-dev-openai-api-key \
  --secret-string '<your-sk-proj-key>'
```

### 4. Push a placeholder backend image to ECR, then deploy Compute

`cdk deploy` of the ComputeStack will fail at App Runner creation if the ECR repo is empty — App Runner needs an image to start the service. The bootstrap dance:

```bash
# Deploy Compute with --no-rollback so the ECR repo survives App
# Runner's expected first-boot failure. Without --no-rollback,
# CloudFormation rolls the whole stack back, deleting the ECR repo
# before we get a chance to push to it.
npx cdk deploy magnacms-dev-compute --no-rollback -c env=dev
# Compute will fail at App Runner creation — that's expected. The ECR
# repo survives in CREATE_COMPLETE state.

# Build + push the real backend image. ECR repo name is deterministic
# (`magnacms-dev-backend`) so look it up directly instead of digging
# CloudFormation outputs out of a failed-state stack.
ECR_URI=$(aws ecr describe-repositories \
  --repository-names magnacms-dev-backend \
  --query 'repositories[0].repositoryUri' --output text)
aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-1 \
  | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin "$ECR_URI"
docker build -t "$ECR_URI:latest" ../backend/
docker push "$ECR_URI:latest"

# Now retry the deploy — App Runner should succeed this time.
# Drop --no-rollback now; subsequent deploys want normal rollback behavior.
npx cdk deploy magnacms-dev-compute -c env=dev
```

### 5. Deploy remaining stacks

```bash
npx cdk deploy magnacms-dev-edge magnacms-dev-observability -c env=dev
```

If you ever need to rotate the OpenAI key after Compute is RUNNING, App Runner picks up the new value on next deploy. Force a redeploy with:

```bash
APPRUNNER_ARN=$(aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
  --stack-name magnacms-dev-compute \
  --query "Stacks[0].Outputs[?ExportName=='magnacms-dev-compute-apprunner-service-arn'].OutputValue" \
  --output text)
aws apprunner start-deployment --service-arn "$APPRUNNER_ARN"
```

### 6. Run initial migrations

```bash
MIGRATION_CLUSTER=$(aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
  --stack-name magnacms-dev-compute \
  --query "Stacks[0].Outputs[?ExportName=='magnacms-dev-compute-migration-cluster-arn'].OutputValue" \
  --output text)
MIGRATION_TASK_DEF=$(aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
  --stack-name magnacms-dev-compute \
  --query "Stacks[0].Outputs[?ExportName=='magnacms-dev-compute-migration-task-arn'].OutputValue" \
  --output text)
SUBNETS=$(aws ec2 describe-subnets \
  --filters "Name=tag:environment,Values=dev" \
            "Name=map-public-ip-on-launch,Values=true" \
  --query 'Subnets[].SubnetId' --output text | tr '\t' ',')

aws ecs run-task \
  --cluster "$MIGRATION_CLUSTER" \
  --task-definition "$MIGRATION_TASK_DEF" \
  --launch-type FARGATE \
  --network-configuration "awsvpcConfiguration={subnets=[$SUBNETS],assignPublicIp=ENABLED}"
```

Watch for the task to reach STOPPED with exit code 0 in the ECS console. Logs are in the `/aws/ecs/...` log group.

### 7. Smoke test `/health`

```bash
APPRUNNER_URL=$(aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
  --stack-name magnacms-dev-compute \
  --query "Stacks[0].Outputs[?ExportName=='magnacms-dev-compute-apprunner-service-url'].OutputValue" \
  --output text)
curl -fsSL "https://$APPRUNNER_URL/api/v1/health"
```

Expected: `{"status":"ok","version":"0.1.0","environment":"dev","dependencies":{...}}`.

### 8. Update post-deploy env vars (App Runner + Amplify)

The compute stack ships with placeholder values that need real URLs once EdgeStack is up. Two consoles to visit.

**App Runner** → `magnacms-dev-backend` → Configuration → Environment variables:

1. Update `CORS_ORIGINS` to include `https://<branch>.<amplify-app-id>.amplifyapp.com`
2. Leave `IMAGES_CDN_BASE_URL` empty until CloudFront-for-images lands in Phase 5

App Runner force-redeploys on env-var change.

**Amplify** → `magnacms-dev` → App settings → Environment variables:

1. Add `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` = `https://<apprunner-url>/api/v1`
2. (Optional) `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` once you provision a Sentry project

Without `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`, the built frontend defaults to `http://localhost:8000/api/v1` and every request fails in production. Trigger a fresh Amplify build after the env update so the new value is baked into the bundle.

### 8a. Set CloudWatch log retention manually

ObservabilityStack pre-creates two log groups, but App Runner ignores them and creates its own under `/aws/apprunner/<service-name>/<service-id>/...` where the service-id is randomly assigned. After App Runner is RUNNING, find the real log groups and set retention:

```bash
SERVICE_ID=$(aws apprunner describe-service \
  --service-arn "$APPRUNNER_ARN" \
  --query 'Service.ServiceId' --output text)
for stream in service application; do
  aws logs put-retention-policy \
    --log-group-name "/aws/apprunner/magnacms-dev-backend/$SERVICE_ID/$stream" \
    --retention-in-days 14
done
```

The pre-created groups can be deleted (`aws logs delete-log-group ...`) — they're never used.

### 9. **PREFLIGHT: Verify rate-limit IP identity** (P1.10 follow-up — critical)

The rate limiter in `app/middleware/rate_limit.py` keys on `scope["client"]`. Verify that App Runner forwards the real client IP rather than its internal load-balancer peer:

```bash
# From a single source IP, hit /auth/login 11 times in 60s.
for i in $(seq 1 11); do
  curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" \
    -X POST "https://$APPRUNNER_URL/api/v1/auth/login" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"x"}'
done
```

Expected: ten 401s (invalid credentials), then a 429 (rate-limited) on attempt 11.

**If you get 429 immediately on attempt 1 or 2, the limiter is keying on App Runner's load-balancer peer IP, not the real client.** Every user shares one bucket — global throttling at 10 req/min. Fix before going public:

1. Add `TRUST_PROXY_XFF=true` env var to App Runner
2. Update `rate_limit.py` to read `X-Forwarded-For` when the flag is set, scoped to App Runner egress IPs as trusted proxies

(See P1.10 plan notes for the follow-up code change.)

### 10. Connect Amplify to GitHub

CDK creates the Amplify app shell but can't auto-connect to a GitHub repo without an OAuth token. From the Amplify console:

1. Amplify → `magnacms-dev` → App settings → Repository settings → Reconnect repository
2. Authorize the GitHub App for `Eslam93/MagnaCMS`
3. Confirm the `main` branch is detected and auto-deploys are enabled

First Amplify build runs against the current `main` HEAD.

### 11. Record the live URLs in README

In the project root `README.md` §1 "Live demo":

```markdown
- **Backend**: https://<apprunner-url>/api/v1/health
- **Frontend**: https://<amplify-branch>.<amplify-app-id>.amplifyapp.com
```

### 12. Flip `deploy.yml` to auto-trigger

Once the manual deploy succeeds end-to-end (above), update `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:

```yaml
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      env: ...
  push:
    branches: [main]
    paths:
      - 'backend/**'
      - '.github/workflows/deploy.yml'
```

Also add the required GitHub Secrets:

- `AWS_DEPLOY_ROLE_ARN` — OIDC role ARN from your bootstrap. Create with `aws iam create-role` + the GitHub OIDC trust policy (see [AWS docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_create_oidc.html)).

## Routine deploys (after first-deploy bootstrap)

Once everything is set up, every push to `main` that touches `backend/` triggers `deploy.yml` automatically. The workflow:

1. OIDC-assumes the deploy role
2. Builds + pushes the backend Docker image to ECR (`:latest` + `:<sha>`)
3. Runs migrations as a Fargate one-off task
4. Triggers App Runner deployment
5. Waits for RUNNING status
6. Smoke-tests `/health`

If any step fails, the workflow exits non-zero and notifies on the PR / commit.

## Teardown

```bash
cd infra
npx cdk destroy --all -c env=dev
# Plus: delete the Amplify app manually from the console
#       (CDK has trouble removing Amplify apps connected to GitHub)
```

## Known issues

- **App Runner first deploy without a pushed image fails.** That's expected (see step 4). Push the image, then retry.
- **`amplify.yml` not yet present.** Lands in P2.9a (frontend scaffold). Until then, the inline buildSpec in EdgeStack serves as the build config.
- **CloudFront for images is deferred to Phase 5.** EdgeStack ships Amplify only because of a circular dependency between DataStack and CloudFront-for-S3 OAC. See PR #124 for the full reasoning.
- **The `prod` environment isn't wired.** `loadConfig('prod')` throws at startup. Adding prod is a single-PR follow-up — copy the dev entry in `lib/config.ts`, tighten instance sizes/retention/devIpAllowlist, switch removalPolicy to RETAIN, set `multi-AZ: true` on RDS.
