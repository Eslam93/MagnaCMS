/**
 * ObservabilityStack tests.
 *
 * The stack is currently a placeholder — App Runner log-group
 * pre-creation was removed in P2.12 (the names had no service-id, so
 * App Runner ignored them and created its own without retention).
 * Log-retention setup is now a post-deploy `aws logs put-retention-policy`
 * step documented in DEPLOY.md §7a.
 *
 * The stack will gain content again in P11.6 (CloudWatch 5xx alarm
 * + SNS topic). Until then these tests just assert it synths cleanly
 * with no resources.
